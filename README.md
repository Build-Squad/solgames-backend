## Getting Started

To set up the Chessmate backend locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or above)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Redis** [Download here](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Build-Squad/solgames-backend.git
cd solgames-backend
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Server Locally

1. **Database Setup**: Start the database server and make sure you've a database named 'web3_chess' on your running postgres server.
2. Configure your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory and copy paste the content from `.env.example` in the root directory.
3. Make sure your redis server is running, to check run `redis-cli` in your terminal and see if it's running.
4. For escrow API keys, contact the admin of the repository.
5. For PLATFORM_KEYS, you can create a new solana wallet and put in some SOL that'll be used as gas fee while creating games (creating escrow).

6. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   # or
   yarn start:dev
   ```

7. Your server should now be running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
